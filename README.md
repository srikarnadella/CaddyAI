As an avid golfer I wanted to create an app to help me improve my game and since I can't have it swing for me (yet) I decided to create an app that does the next best thing, tell me how to swing. My goal is to create an app that takes an input of my yardages and statistics regarding the ball path and the conditions of the current shot, and then returns the club I should use as well as how far I should aim for. This app is using a React Native front end with a python backend. I am working on implementing a decision tree model that helps calculate and determine the shot I should aim for.
